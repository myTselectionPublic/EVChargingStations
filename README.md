# Public EV Charging Stations Home Assistant integration
Home Assistant custom component to create sensors with information on the available EV Charging Station in a chosen area. This custom component has been built from the ground up to bring public site data to compare and save on your EV prices and integrate this information into Home Assistant. This integration is built against the public websites provided by Eneco.com and other similar sites. Sensors will be created for nearest stations of different speeds and availability. 

**Currently supporting charging stations in EU from [Eneco](https://www.eneco-emobility.com/be-nl/chargemap) and [Shell](https://ui-map.shellrecharge.com/).**

This integration is in no way affiliated with Eneco.com. This integration is based on my other [Carbu.com](https://github.com/myTselectionPublic/Carbu_com) custom integration, which brings similar functionality for fuel/gas stations.

Large parts of the code base has been based on the [Shell Recharge](https://github.com/cyberjunky/home-assistant-shell_recharge) custom integration. The same functionality is available, but has been extended to support Eneco charging stations and to automatically find the stations that matches criteria.

| :warning: Please don't report issues with this integration to other platforms, they will not be able to support you. |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|


For electricity price expectations [this Entso-E HACS integration](https://github.com/JaccoR/hass-entso-e) can be used.


<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/myTselectionPublic/EVChargingStations/master/logo.png"/></p>

With this integration it will be possible to:
- subscribe to specific charging point, to make it possible to get notified once available
- get sensors (can be shown on map) with:
   - charging station **nearest** to location (straight line distance)
   - **available** charging station **nearest** to location
   - **high** speed charging station **nearest** to location
   - **high** speed **available** charging station **nearest** to location
   - **super high** speed charging station **nearest** to location
   - **super high** speed **available** charging station **nearest** to

TODO : find cheapest charging station:
   - **cheapest** charging stations and nearest to location
   - **available** **cheapest** charging stations and nearest to location
   - **high** speed charging station **cheapest** and nearest to location
   - **high** speed **available** **cheapest** charging stations and nearest to location
   - **super high** speed **cheapest** charging station and nearest to location
   - **super high** speed **available** **cheapest** charging station and nearest to location



## Installation
- [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/): search for Carbu in the default HACS repo list or use below button to navigate directly to it on your local system and install via HACS. 
   -    [![Open your Home Assistant instance and open the repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg?style=flat-square)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=myTselectionPublic&repository=EVChargingStations&category=integration)
- Restart Home Assistant
- Add 'EV Charging Stations' integration via HA Settings > 'Devices and Services' > 'Integrations'
- Choose the type of charging station to setup: nearest public station, specific station or Shell station with credentials.
- For 'Public nearest station':
   - Provide any 'origin': this can be a coordinate eg: "51.330436, 3.802043" or "street, city, country" or any sensor name which has latitude and longitutde coordinate attributes eg "person.fred" or "device_tracker.car_position"
- For 'Public single Shell charge station':
   - Provide the unique serial number of the charging station: the serial number can be found in the details of a charging station on [https://ui-map.shellrecharge.com](https://ui-map.shellrecharge.com)
- For 'Private Shell charge station':
   - Provide Shell credentials username and password

## Status
Proof of concept status, still validating and extending functionalities. [Issues](https://github.com/myTselectionPublic/EVChargingStations/issues) section in GitHub.

## Technical pointers
The main logic and API connection related code can be found within source code Carbu.com/custom_components/Carbu.com:
- [sensor.py](https://github.com/myTselectionPublic/EVChargingStations/blob/master/custom_components/EVChargingStations/sensor.py)
- [coordinator.py](https://github.com/myTselectionPublic/EVChargingStations/blob/master/custom_components/EVChargingStations/coordinator.py)
- [evrecharge.py EVApi](https://github.com/myTselectionPublic/EVChargingStations/blob/master/custom_components/EVChargingStations/evrecharge/__init__.py)

All other files just contain boilerplat code for the integration to work wtihin HA or to have some constants/strings/translations.

If you would encounter some issues with this custom component, you can enable extra debug logging by adding below into your `configuration.yaml`:
```
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
     custom_components.EVChargingStations: debug
```

## Example usage: Show map

### Nearest map

To show a map in Home Assistant with all nearest charging stations you can use a setup such as shown below. It will show the max kWh charging power on map.

   ```
   type: map
   entities:
     - entity: sensor.nearest_station_device_tracker_car_position
       label_mode: attribute
       attribute: map_label
       focus: false
     - entity: >-
         sensor.nearest_available_station_device_tracker_car_position
       label_mode: attribute
       attribute: map_label
       focus: true
     - entity: >-
         sensor.nearest_highspeed_station_device_tracker_car_position
       label_mode: attribute
       attribute: map_label
       focus: false
     - entity: >-
         sensor.nearest_available_highspeed_station_device_tracker_car_position
       label_mode: attribute
       attribute: map_label
       focus: true
     - entity: >-
         sensor.nearest_superhighspeed_station_device_tracker_car_position
       label_mode: attribute
       attribute: map_label
       focus: false
     - entity: >-
         sensor.nearest_available_superhighspeed_station_device_tracker_car_position
       label_mode: attribute
       attribute: map_label
       focus: true
     - entity: device_tracker.car_position
   theme_mode: auto

   ```

### Eneco map

To show the [Eneco charging map](https://www.eneco-emobility.com/be-nl/chargemap) for a specific location linked to some sensor in Home Assistant IFrame you can:
- install [Config Template Card HACS](https://github.com/iantrich/config-template-card)
- define a template sensor to dynamically build the website url based on sensor coordinates
   - in `configuration.yaml`
   ```
   template:
     - sensor:
      - name: "Car Eneco Charging Station URL"
        state: >
          https://www.eneco-emobility.com/be-nl/chargemap#loc={{ state_attr('device_tracker.car_position', 'latitude') }}%2C{{ state_attr('device_tracker.car_position', 'longitude') }}%2C16

   ```
   
- create a new card in frontend with config such as shown below:
     
   ```
   type: custom:config-template-card
   entities:
     - sensor.car_eneco_charging_station_url
   variables:
     - states
   card:
     type: iframe
     aspect_ratio: 185%
     url: ${states['sensor.car_eneco_charging_station_url'].state}

   ```

## Example info markdown card
Below markdown will only show unique charging stations, so if nearest and nearest available are the same, it will only be shown once.

A link towards Eneco chargemap is available on the name of the charging stations

A link to Google maps directions from car to charging station is available on the address of the charging station

An indication of exepcted speed of charging (km/min and km/hour of charging)

To re-use, replace 
- `device_tracker_car_position` with origin used during setup of EVChargingStation
- `device_tracker.car_position` with entity id or sensor name of your car (or similar)
- `sensor.car_soc` with entity id of car battery charge status % SoC
- `person.jef` with entity id of person

```
